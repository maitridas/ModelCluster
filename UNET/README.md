## Introduction
UNET is a convolutional neural network commonly used for segmentation related. Here I have attempted to implement UNET in pytorch

```

## Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies by running
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files Structure
- model.py : Contains the UNET model
- summary.py : Contains the code to show the model architecture
- test.py : Test to see whether the UNET model is working properly

## Run the tests
```
python test.py
```

## Get the model summary
```
python summary.py
```
